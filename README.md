# 🧠 LLM & Machine Learning Notebooks

A collection of exploratory notebooks covering topics in **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **Machine Learning**. This repo serves as a personal lab for experimentation, prototyping, and documentation of learning in the AI/ML space.

## 🔍 Topics Covered

- 📚 **Large Language Models**
  - Prompt engineering
  - Fine-tuning & adapters (LoRA, PEFT)
  - Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
  - Tokenization & embeddings
  - Evaluation techniques

- 🤖 **Machine Learning**
  - Supervised learning (classification, regression)
  - Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction)
  - Model evaluation (ROC, AUC, precision-recall)
  - Feature engineering & selection
  - Pipelines with Scikit-Learn and others

- 📊 **Experimentation**
  - Benchmarking model performance
  - Data preprocessing and visualization
